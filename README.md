üìù Description

This project analyzes the likelihood of individuals working in the tech industry seeking mental health treatment, based on their work environment and personal background. Using survey data,
it explores how factors such as remote work, family history of mental illness, workplace interference, and available mental health support options influence the decision to seek treatment.
The data was cleaned and label-encoded before training a logistic regression model. The model achieved an accuracy of *81%*, performing particularly well in predicting individuals who have received treatment.

The most influential features in predicting treatment were a family history of mental health issues, how much mental health affects work performance, and whether the company offers mental health benefits. 
These findings emphasize the importance of supportive workplace policies for employee well-being.
This project serves as a complete data science workflow, covering data preprocessing, categorical encoding, classification modeling, and performance evaluation.
